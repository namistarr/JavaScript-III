/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Object Binding means that without binding the "this" keyword to anything the value of "this" will be the window object.
* 2. Implicit Binding means that "this" points to what is to the left of the period when the function is called.
* 3. New Binding means that the "new" keyword constructs a ndw object, and "this" points to it.
* 4. Explicit Binding means that we can set "this" to point to a certain value using "call", "apply", or "bind".
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

// Principle 1

// code example for Window Binding

// Principle 2

// code example for Implicit Binding

const vampireSlayer = {
    name: 'Buffy',
    seasons: '7 Seasons!',
    slayer: function (){
        console.log(this.name);

// Principle 3

// code example for New Binding

function VampireSlayer(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

let vampireSlayer = new Slayer('Buffy the Vampire Slayer');
console.log(vampireSlayer.name);

// Principle 4
